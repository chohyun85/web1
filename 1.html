<p>Alexis Sanchez insists Manchester United are the biggest club in England and says he nearly moved to Old Trafford when Sir Alex Ferguson was in charge.</p>
The Chilean completed his move from Arsenal on Monday, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan heading to the Emirates as part of a swap deal, and will wear the iconic No 7 shirt at Old Trafford.<br>
Sanchez spent three-and-a-half-years at Arsenal and it appeared as though he was heading to Manchester City before Pep Guardiola's side ended their interest in the 29-year-old due to costs, but Sanchez insists he has always dreamed of playing for United and believes he has signed for the biggest club in the country.
